# JAN-KEN GAME (Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game)

This is my mini-project series from Progate in which I learn how to make the Rock Paper Scissors game called the Jan-Ken Game, 
also known as the "Japanese Suit." This game can then be accessed via browser https://jan-ken-game-japanese-suit.netlify.app/

This game has the following features or specifications:
1. Responsive page that can be accessed via desktop and mobile devices
1. Can play Japanese Suit against Ninja Ken (bots)
1. Game reset button to reset score to 0
1. Scores can be saved with the auto save feature, and don't disappear when tabs or web pages are closed in the browser

This is how the game appears on a mobile device
